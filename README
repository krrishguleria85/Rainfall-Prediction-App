Rainfall Prediction Web Application üå¶Ô∏è ->
An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts whether it will rain the next day. This application uses a Logistic Regression model trained on historical weather data and features a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit that fetches live weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.

‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning Workflow
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values in the dataset by filling them with the mean or mode.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized feature distributions and relationships to gain insights.

Feature Engineering: Converted categorical features (like WindGustDir and RainTomorrow) into a numerical format using one-hot encoding and mapping.

Model Training: Trained a Logistic Regression model on 80% of the data.

Model Evaluation: Achieved 89.09% accuracy on the 20% test set, validating the model performance.

Model Saving: The trained model was saved into a .joblib file for use in the web application.
